dc_sample -> Code for motor and servo movements and wifi connection

## How to run

1.) Run "main_esp" for the ESP-32. This will start the wifi-server and get it ready to receive commands for moving the motors (open/close servos, move the DC motors, etc).
2.) Connect your computer to the wifi network "Madhu-ESP-Network"
3.) Run the Matlab GUI "guiApp.mlapp". Open/close the servo motor grippers with the switches, and move the racks / DC motors with the sliders.
